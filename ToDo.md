Very Important
==============

- After the next merge (wanke <-> hosokawa) search once again for NSUserDefaults and make sure there is no new reference to user_id or so

Needs Testing
=============

- Icon badge was complety rewritten. Does this still work?
    - Confirmed that it works. Push Messages was not testet though

- Push Messages:
    - Do they produce an icon badge?
    - Does it work if Gocci is in Background AND if Gocci is not running at all?
