Very Important
==============

- After the next merge (wanke <-> hosokawa) search once again for NSUserDefaults and make sure there is no new reference to user_id or so

Needs Testing
=============

- Icon badge was complety rewritten. Does this still work?
    - Confirmed that it works. Push Messages was not testet though

- Push Messages:
    - Do they produce an icon badge?
    - Does it work if Gocci is in Background AND if Gocci is not running at all?

- Login

- Upload

- live branch conversion error


Daiki Hosokawa
==============

- sort button
- Userpage
- restaurantpage
- mute
- twitter消す

Markus Wanke
============


 -  Remove the Facebook Sharekit when we get [publish_permission]

 -  Call the new register_device_token URI when the device token changes

 -  You removed setting the FB_CONSUMER_KEY from AppDelegate. that means get rid of SNSUtil now

 -  That the image is downloaded everytime is retarded. No saved url
