- Let the user decide what messages he wants. Gettings 100 likes is not fun maybe, but he probably wants to see the messages

- If the user declines camera and/or mic permission, the user will never be able to take a video

- put all the showPopupWithTransitionStyle code douplicates in an extension

- Mute function

- Remove the Facebook Sharekit when we get [publish_permission]

- That the image is downloaded everytime is retarded. No saved url

- Show busy indicator on password relogin, sns relogin, username signup
