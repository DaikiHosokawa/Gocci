Needs Testing
=============

- Icon badge was complety rewritten. Does this still work?
    - Confirmed that it works. Push Messages was not testet though

- Push Messages:
    - Do they produce an icon badge?
    - Does it work if Gocci is in Background AND if Gocci is not running at all?

- Login

- Upload

- live branch conversion error


Would be cool
=============

- Let the users set their profile image from twitter or facebook login. half of the code already exists

============


- Let the user dice what messages he wants. Gettings 100 likes is not fun maybe, but he probably wants to see the messages

- If the user declines camera and/or mic permission, the user will never be able to take a video

- put all the showPopupWithTransitionStyle code douplicates in an extension

- Mute function

- Remove the Facebook Sharekit when we get [publish_permission]

- That the image is downloaded everytime is retarded. No saved url

- Show busy indicator on password relogin, sns relogin, username signup
